# Balloon Tracker Software
Python3 code that uses the OpenCV library to track small, balloon-like objects. 

## What does each file do?
`tracker.py`: Python tracking code that tracks a user-defined object in an inputted video file (`video.mov`).

`graph_generator.py`: Generates (smoothed) graphs of the data given CSV file input

`propeller_controller.ino`: Arduino code that controls the propellers. More info available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlSEalDKJdNWVXWj4crKdMKH4CGX_jqdr1-A1DC-urU/edit).

`video.mov`: An example of what type of video file works with the tracker.

## How do I test out the code for myself?
